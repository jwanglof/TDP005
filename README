BUGS

HOW-TO PLAY
	To play this game you have to compile it using the installation notes.
	When the compilation is done you have an executable file called 'Super' in the folder. To run this you only need to type ./Super in the same folder.

	When started you are asked to write your 3 character initiales. When you've done this you need to press 'Y'.

	Now you're in the main menu and I think the menu-entries are self-explained.
	To move around in the menu you can either use the arrows, W or S.
	To select a menu-entry you can either press Space or Return.

	To move the player in the game you use the 'WASD'-keyboard keys. To shoot you press your left mouse-button, and you aim by pointing your mouse-pointer at the enemy you want to shoot.
